# Copy-Range-to-Like-Sheets
Open-source VBA project that allows a user to copy the cells within a specified range from one sheet to like sheets throughout the rest of the workbook. Useful with workbooks containing dozens or even hundreds of worksheets.

To install, open up whatever Excel file you want this functionality for, get to the VBA editor window by menu navigation or using ALT+F11, then go to File -> Import and select this file. Make a save before using this macro, as you cannot undo any changes it makes. Call the macro "CRtLS" using either F8 or other Excel menu navigations. Follow the instructions and prompts given.
