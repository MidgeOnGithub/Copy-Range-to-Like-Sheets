# Copy-Range-to-Like-Sheets
Open-source VBA project that allows a user to copy chosen Excel range from a parent sheet to all like sheets throughout the rest of the workbook. Useful with workbooks containing dozens or even hundreds of worksheets.

To install, open up whatever Excel file you want this functionality for, get to the VBA editor window by menu navigation or using ALT+F11, then go to File -> Import and select CRtLS.bas. Make a save to your workbook before using this macro: you cannot undo any changes the macro makes. Call the macro "CRtLS" using either F8 or menu navigations. Follow the instructions and prompts given.
